# ESP Configurator client

See <https://github.com/HankB/ESP_Configurator> for an overview and <https://github.com/HankB/ESP_Configurator_Server> for the corresponding server. The protocol is described in the server README.

The client broadcasts a request for configuration including the MAC address for identification and then waits for configuration messages from the server.
